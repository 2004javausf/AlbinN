In Java we have primitive and reference types
Primitive -8 types
	char 16
	boolean 1
	byte 8
	short 16
	int 32
	long 64
	float 32
	double 64
*** look up and memorize bit size for each***

Reference - an object; more than just a value
	Java is a passes by value. It passes the values
		of references rather than the references themselves
Numeric type conversions
	look out for loss of precision
	narrowing
	widening
